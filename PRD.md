`[e.g., User signs up → Creates project → Invites collaborator → Completes task]`

### ✅ Key MVP Features
- `[ ] Feature 1`
- `[ ] Feature 2`
- `[ ] Feature 3`

### 🚫 Out-of-Scope (Won’t-Have)
- `[e.g., No social login, no mobile app, no analytics in V1]`

---

## 4. 🧑‍🎨 Design & UX

## 6. ⚙️ Development Methodology (Directive)

### Phase 1: Pre-Computation & Architecture Plan

**AI Actions**:
1. ✅ **Deconstruct Application Blueprint** – extract all features and user requirements.
2. ✅ **Propose Tech Stack (if not defined)** – recommend Python frameworks/tools that match app goals.
3. ✅ **Define Data Architecture**:
   - Design DB schema with tables/models, data types, constraints.
   - Include standardized naming (e.g., `session_id`, `created_at`, `is_active`).
   - Build a **checklist** of required models.
4. ✅ **Outline Application Structure**:
   - **Backend**: List REST endpoints (method, path, description).
   - **Folder/File Plan**: Visualize full project structure.
   - Provide checklist of all files/folders.
5. ✅ **Seek User Approval** before starting implementation.

### Phase 2: Iterative Feature Development

**For Each Feature**:
- `[ ] Backend - Models/Migrations`
- `[ ] Backend - Logic Layer (validation, services)`
- `[ ] API - Endpoint handlers`
- `[ ] (If applicable) Frontend Component or CLI Handler`
- `[ ] State or data flow management`
- `[ ] Integration of Frontend <-> Backend`
- `[ ] Responsiveness / UX considerations`
- `[ ] Extensive inline comments and summaries`
- `[ ] Final internal review before presenting`

### Phase 3: Finalization & Handoff

- ✅ **Validate Checklists** – ensure all components/files were created.
- ✅ **Assemble Full Application** – ensure full integration and runnability.
- ✅ **Generate README.md** with:
  - Project description
  - Install & run instructions
  - Features descriptions
  - Technologies used
- ✅ **Run Code Quality Checks**
- ✅ **Final Review & Delivery**
